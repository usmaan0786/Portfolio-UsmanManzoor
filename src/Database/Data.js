        approximately 3000 images for each color class, sourced from our e-commerce datasets. The models undergo training to adeptly edit
        input images, generating precise and visually appealing outcomes. The editing process is guided by the conditioned label, ensuring a
        personalized approach for each colorâ€”be it green, red, black, or blue.`,
